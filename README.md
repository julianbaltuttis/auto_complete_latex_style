# auto_complete_latex_style
Autohotkey script for Windows that allows auto completion for mathematical symbols in UTF-8.

Requires [Auto Hot Key](https://www.autohotkey.com) to compile.

Use the pound sign `#` as an  identifier prefix (rather than `/` as in Latex).

For instance
`#alpha` becomes `α`.

I used the latex equivalent identifiers in most cases, except where the latex ones are just plain stupid.

Eg `/rightarrow`  is `#ra`.
