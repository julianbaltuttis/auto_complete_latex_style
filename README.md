# auto_complete_latex_style
Autohotkey script for Windows that allows auto completion for mathematical symbols in UTF-8.

Use the pound sign `#` as an  identifier prefix (rather than `/` as in Latex).

For instance
`#alpha` becomes `Î±`.

I used the latex equivalent identifiers in most cases, except where the latex ones are just plain stupid.

Eg `/rightarrow`  is `#ra`.
